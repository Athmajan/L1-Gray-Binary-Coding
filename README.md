# L1-Gray-Binary-Coding

1. Create a simulation model composed of a random bit source,
A) 64â€“QAM, B) 16-QAM, C) 8-PSK

2. Plot constellations (in every modulator-block there is View Constellation -button) and
compare modulators.

3. Perform Monte Carlo simulation of BER vs. SNR and SER vs. SNR for all listed modulators
using Gray and binary coding and plot the curves.

4. Compare BER and SER curves.
